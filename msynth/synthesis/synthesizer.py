class Synthesizer:
    """
    Expression synthesis based on input-output (I/O) samples.

    Based on a number of I/O samples (provided via a synthesis oracle),
    it tries to stochastically learn an expression with the same I/O behavior.
    For this, it considers program synthesis as a stochastic optimization problem:
    It randomly mutates a synthesis state (expression), measures the differences in
    the output behavior between the synthesis state and the oracle output
    using a distance function. The goal is to minimize the distance until the
    I/O behavior is the same.

    The synthesizer makes use of a grammar to generate random expressions. To mutate
    expressions, it uses a mutator that applies small changes to the synthesis state.

    The approach is inspired by:

    The synthesizer provides the functionality to synthesize an expression based on a 
    given (complex) expression that represents a mathematical function f(x0, ..., xi) 
    with i inputs. Based on this expression, synthesis oracle, grammar and mutator
    will be automatically initialized. The synthesis can also be processed in parallel.

        Synthesizes an expression from a given expression that represents a function f(x0, ..., xi).

        The function constructs a synthesis oracle, a grammar and a mutator. Afterward, it
        performs the stochastic search. To deal with memory, memory accesses are replaced with
        variable accesses and re-applied afterward to the synthesized expression.

        Example:

        The given expression @64[rax] + rbx - rbx is unified to p0 + p1 - p1. A synthesized
        expression p0 with he same I/O behavior is p0. After re-applying the initial variables,

        Performs an iterative local search (ILS) to synthesize an expression for a given synthesis oracle.

        The algorithm tries to find a synthesis state that minimizes the distance function. Starting with an AST
        representing a single leaf, it iteratively switches between perturbation and side search. The perturbation
        mutates the best state (found so far) by replacing a subexpression with a leaf node. Afterward, it tries 
        to find better synthesis states in the side search by applying more aggressive mutations. The mutated state is
        discarded, unless it is better than the current state. If the side search does not find a better state
        (with a lower score) within 100 iterations, the algorithm continues with perturbation.

        (1) the synthesis state's score is 0 (synthesis state and oracle have the same I/O behavior) or
